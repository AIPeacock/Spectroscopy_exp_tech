Plan:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{Intro what is spectroscopy and applications and how does work ? }
    \item{Method: what was the setup in this experiment and what were we doing}
    \item{Results: Red filter with air and silica, two "blue" filters, silicon mirror determine optical band gap.}
    \item{Conc: sum up results and use of spectroscopy.}
\end{enumerate}
